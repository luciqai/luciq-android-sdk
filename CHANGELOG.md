# Luciq Android SDK Changelog

## 18.0.1 (Oct 10, 2025)

### Enhancements
- Optimizes SDK's `UncaughtExceptionHandler` operations to prevent ANRs from occurring while the application is exiting (crashing).
- Mutes a few diagnostics logs to reduce noise in the logcat.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixes an issue where features cache was being stored before features states were properly consumed, which could lead to inconsistent SDK behavior under special conditions.
- Fixes an issue with email format validation causing malformed emails to be sent with crash reports.
- Fixes a crash, `ActivityNotFoundException`, encountered while attaching extra images to bug reports via Android's [new photo picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photo-picker) on some devices by falling back to the legacy photo picker instead.
- Fixes a race condition that causes chats synchronization request to get fired while chats being disabled with `Replies` APIs.
- Fixes an issue that causes interactions tracking for Jetpack Compose screens to yield inaccurate results when a overlay Composable is present.
